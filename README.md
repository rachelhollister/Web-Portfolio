# Updated-Portfolio

### Required: Update your Portfolio Site -- Employer Ready

To receive a passing grade on this assignment, you should meet the following content and design requirements. These are aligned with what you will need to be
[employer ready](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhzeIUMYf1nV2JQcGdkU3ktcnFBLUZ4X09VSXliTUtJZWsw/view).

#### Content

Your updated site should have the following content:

* Your name - YES

* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address - YES

* List of projects. For each project make sure you have the following:

* Project title - YES

* Link to the deployed version - YES

* Link to the code on GitHub - YES

* At least one project should include back end code - YES

* For each of your projects, copy the repos to your own GitHub profile if you were not the owner of the repo - YES

* Create your own repo and DO NOT INITIALIZE WITH A GITIGNORE OR A README - YES

* Pull the latest version of the project from GitHub - YES

* [Change the `origin` URL to your repository](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/)

* `git push origin master` - YES

#### Design

The content of your portfolio page is a lot more important than the aesthetics. That said, there are a couple basic requirements your portfolio page should meet:

* Mobile-friendliness: you don't need advanced responsive styles, but you should ensure that your portfolio page is still readable on different screen sizes

* Readability: make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.








### Suggested: Update Portfolio -- Employer Competitive

To receive an "A" on this assignment, you should also meet the following requirements
to ensure your portfolio site will help you be [employer competitive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhzeIUMYf1nV2JQcGdkU3ktcnFBLUZ4X09VSXliTUtJZWsw/view).

#### Competitive Content

* At least 5 deployed projects (both of your projects and three homework assignments)

* External content:

* Update your LinkedIn with the projects you've worked on so far

* Update the README for each project you linked to with a description of the problem,
how you solved it, and some information about your technical approach

* Suggested: refactor some of your code from earlier assignments to make them more readable

* If you used cors-anywhere in Project 1, update it to make sure your API calls will work consistently

* Use the instructions in [update-cors-anywhere/README.md](./update-cors-anywhere/README.md)

* Test to make sure your deployed site works

#### Competitive Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a couple guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design: you should be proud to pull out your phone and share
your portfolio site with a friend, family member, or someone at a meetup.

* Polish: choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Images: add a meaningful screenshot for each of your projects
